            <p>This experience of creating a website from scartch where you are given the opputunity to decide the theme of the site has proven to be very beneficial.It has instilled in me the strive to carry on with a task which i'm passionate about.</p>
                
            <p>For the first few weeks i was quite doubtful about the topic that i had chosen unlike other segments such as travelling,photography this one seemed to have less reousrces in order to correlate and ultimately have a website based upon it.But with some research i was able to get as many resources and blog ideas about learning which has been published my many good authorsnd they greatly nspired me to pursue something on the same myself. </p>
			<p>With the initial analysis and reasearch, my progress was certainily delayed and also because of the fact that i was quite not sure what elements are necessary for such blog/site.But i have come a long way from that stage and now i am confident that i can carry on with improving this site and turn into something more meaniful and useful.</p>
            <p>Some of the glitches that i came across while doing some part of the assignments are:<p>
			<ul>
<li>For the task make gallery for part 2 of the assignement , i found it quite difficult to find meaningful images for this topic and i also i was quite doubtful about how images are going to help my topic.But as it turned out i was able to put some useful facts and it coheres well with the topic. </li>
<li>It was only later that i realized a video would have been a good fit for my site than a javascript enabled timer.I have decided to include a video as the future extention to the site</li>
<li>Word cloud that i have implemented which consists of googles' most trending words which appears to a logical fit to corelate to the idea of learning but i do think i need to make improvments on that in order it to be more effective and apparent. </li>   
 </ul>
